In Check — MVP Game Description

In Check is a turn-based tactical roguelike where the player controls a single piece: the King.
The board is a grid. Enemies are chess pieces. Damage is not abstract. Distance is damage, and positioning is survival.

Every encounter begins with the player already under threat. If the player does nothing, they will take damage on the enemy phase. There are no surprise attacks, no hidden rolls, and no reactive interrupts. All danger is visible. All mistakes are self-inflicted.

On the player’s turn, actions are drawn from a small deck of cards. Most cards represent movement patterns rather than attacks. Moving onto an enemy’s square deals damage equal to the distance traveled. Every hit attempts to shove the target one tile in the direction of impact, if space allows. This slide rule applies universally and without exception.

The player has a limited number of actions per turn and must decide not only what to do, but where to end the turn. Ending a turn in the wrong square can be lethal, regardless of how many enemies were defeated.

After the player commits their actions, the enemy phase resolves in full. Each enemy acts once, following strict and predictable movement rules based on its chess identity. Enemies do not chain actions. They do not improvise. They exert pressure through geometry, not abilities.

Encounters scale primarily through board size and composition, not raw stats. Early rounds take place on small grids with limited sightlines. Later rounds expand the board, creating longer lanes and more lethal threat vectors. The final encounter introduces the Queen, whose combined movement patterns represent the ultimate spatial threat.

Between encounters, the player visits a shop where gold earned through kills and perfect rounds can be spent to shape the deck. The shop offers a small number of meaningful options: new cards, card removal, utility upgrades, and relics that bend the rules of movement or timing. All purchases increase a run-wide shop inflation value, sharply raising the cost of future purchases. The shop does not make the player stronger indiscriminately. It forces commitment.

The run consists of ten encounters. The objective never changes: clear the board. There are no alternate win conditions. The run ends when the Queen is defeated or the King falls.

The MVP deliberately avoids environmental modifiers such as walls, traps, or terrain effects. The board is empty space. All complexity comes from the interaction between movement, threat, and consequence. If the game is not tense and readable in this state, additional systems are considered failures, not fixes.

In Check is a game about inevitability, foresight, and self-inflicted danger.
You are never safe.
You are always informed.
If you lose, the board told you why.
